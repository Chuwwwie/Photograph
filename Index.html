%div We keep this love in a photograph
%div made these memories for ourselves
%div Where our eyes are never closing
%div Hearts are never broken
%div And time's forever frozen still
%div So you can keep me
%div Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
%div Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
%div You won't ever be alone
%div wait for me to come home
